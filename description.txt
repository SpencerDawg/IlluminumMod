Hello and welcome to the Illuminum Mod!

This is a very work in progress content mod that just adds some simple content. Nothing too fancy!

Currently there are 52 Items total in this mod, Including:
5 Armor Sets
2 Accessories
5 Materials
3 Tools
1 Crafting Station
1 Enemy
31 Weapons - 22 Melee - 5 Ranged - 4 Magic

Currently the mod is very small but I will be trying to update it as much as I can to add some interesting content for your everyday modded runs!

At the moment this mod is not planned to be for standalone mod playthroughs, but that can change over time.
